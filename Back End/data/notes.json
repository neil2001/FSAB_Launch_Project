[{"number":742,"name":"Printer updates","note":"On another front I got the BLTouch installed on Old Faithful. It again is too low for some reason and ground the plate a little bit when I printed the test cube. I will fix that part today. The good news is the Cube was VERY good. Printing with this SS Coated nozzle is the answer. I think we need to order one of those for each Ender so we have a consistent printing process.","postDate":"2020-11-22T17:47:20.176Z"},{"number":6470,"name":"Old Faithful Issues","note":"Atm Old Faithful is down. I can’t seem to get beyond an error code (Blinking red) on the BLTouch unit. Workarounds on the web aren’t working.
